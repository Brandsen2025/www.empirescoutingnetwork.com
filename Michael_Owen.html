        <h2 id="overview" style="color:var(--accent)">Player Overview</h2>
        <p class="lead">Michael Owen was a phenomenon, a striker who defined the late 90s and early 2000s with his electrifying pace and ruthless finishing. After exploding onto the scene at Liverpool as a teenager, he announced his genius to the world with a legendary solo goal against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. His peak came in 2001, when he led Liverpool to a unique cup treble (FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Cup) and was awarded the Ballon d'Or. A "Galáctico" move to Real Madrid followed, and while his career was later famously hampered by recurring hamstring injuries, his peak form represents one of the most potent and exciting strikers in modern history.</p>

        <p class="small"><strong>"Wonder Boy":</strong> His 1998 World Cup goal made him a global superstar overnight. He was the face of English football, carrying the hopes of a nation. His career is also a cautionary tale of "what if," representing one of the most significant "peak vs. longevity" debates in football history, as his world-class ability was so heavily tied to the pace that injuries stole from him.</p>

He was a tactical specialist: a team's game plan would be built around his pace. His experience at Liverpool made him a counter-attacking legend. His time at Real Madrid proved he could score in any league, while his spell at Man Utd under Ferguson showed his adaptation to a "squad role" philosophy, sacrificing ego to contribute to a title-winning team.</p>
