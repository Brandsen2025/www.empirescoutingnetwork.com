        <p class="lead">Sebastián Abreu's career is a unique study in adaptability and longevity. A traditional No. 9, he possessed an elite sense of positioning in the box and was a phenomenal header of the ball, traits that never go out of style. While his club career took him to over 30 teams across a dozen countries (including Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Greece), he was a consistent goalscorer wherever he went. His legacy is cemented in Uruguay's 2010 World Cup run, where his audacious "Panenka" penalty against Ghana sent his team to the semi-finals, perfectly encapsulating his "El Loco" persona. He was also part of the 2011 Copa América winning squad.</p>

              <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> A natural poacher with instinctive positioning and finishing.</li>
              <li><strong>Composure & Penalties:</strong> Ice-cold under pressure. The 2010 Panenka is the ultimate proof.</li>

He is a cult hero, a throwback to an era of charismatic, eccentric strikers. His "Loco" persona was backed by genuine quality, especially his nerve and his aerial dominance.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>World Record Journeyman:</strong> His 31-club career is a testament to his enduring quality as a goalscorer and his unique love for the game. He was a "hired gun" who reliably delivered goals, allowing him to see the world and build a truly unique career. His Panenka in 2010 cemented his place in World Cup folklore.</p>
