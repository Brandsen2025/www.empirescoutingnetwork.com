        <p class="lead">Walter Montillo is a prime example of the classic Argentine "enganche" who found massive success abroad, particularly in South America. After starting at San Lorenzo, his career exploded at Universidad de Chile, where he became a club idol. He was the creative heart of a team that won the league and reached the 2010 Copa Libertadores semi-finals. This form earned him a big-money move to Brazil, where he became one of the best players in the Brasileirão, starring for Cruzeiro and Santos and earning a place in the league's Team of the Year. His game was based on intelligence, quick dribbling, and the ability to deliver defense-splitting passes.</p>
