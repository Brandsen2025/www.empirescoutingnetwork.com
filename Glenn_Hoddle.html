        <p class="lead">Glenn Hoddle is an English football legend, widely considered one of the most naturally talented players his country has ever produced. A Tottenham Hotspur icon (490 apps, 110 goals), he was a "luxury" player in the purest sense, a supremely elegant, two-footed midfielder. His game was not built on pace or tackling, but on "generational" vision, flawless technique, and an imaginative passing range that others couldn't see. He was the creative hub for Spurs, leading them to two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup. He later proved his class abroad, joining Arsène Wenger's AS Monaco and winning the 1987-88 Ligue 1 title, where he was named Foreign Player of the Year.</p>
