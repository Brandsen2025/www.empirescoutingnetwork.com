          <p class="lead">One of the greatest defenders in history and arguably Ireland's best-ever player. A legend at both Manchester United (FA Cup winner) and Aston Villa, where he was nicknamed "God" and won the 1993 PFA Players' Player of the Year. He famously played at a world-class level despite chronic knee injuries that prevented him from training, and personal off-field battles. His 1994 World Cup performance vs. Italy is considered one of the greatest defensive displays of all time.</p>

        <p class="lead">Paul McGrath is an Irish football legend, revered as "God" by Aston Villa fans for his almost supernatural defensive ability. He was a footballing miracle: a player who, due to chronic, debilitating knee injuries, barely trained but would deliver 10/10 performances on match day. He began his career at Manchester United, winning an FA Cup in 1985. After being sold by Alex Ferguson, he found his home at Aston Villa, where he became a club icon, winning the PFA Players' Player of the Year in 1993 and two League Cups. His performance for Ireland against Italy in the 1994 World Cup, while battling a virus and his knee issues, is considered one of the most heroic individual displays in the tournament's history.</p>

He battled alcoholism, crippling stage fright, and knees that had "turned to jelly." Yet, he was a "Cruyff Intelligence" player—a natural "genius" whose brain and anticipation were so advanced, he didn't need to train. He was a "Simeone Cholismo" warrior, sacrificing his body to win tackles. He is a legend not just for his "graceful" play, but for his immense, superhuman courage.</p>
