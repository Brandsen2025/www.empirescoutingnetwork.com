        <p class="lead">Juan Román Riquelme was an artist, a player who belongs to a different era but dominated the modern one. He was the classic "Enganche" (the hook), a pure #10 who operated on his own time. His game was defined by "la pausa"—the ability to stop the game, draw in defenders, and then destroy them with a perfectly weighted through ball that only he could see. A generational set-piece specialist, he was the absolute idol of Boca Juniors, leading them to three Copa Libertadores titles. He also famously led a small Villarreal side to the semi-finals of the Champions League, cementing his status as one of the greatest playmakers of all time.</p>

        <p class="small"><strong>Boca's Greatest Idol:</strong> At Boca Juniors, he is arguably the biggest idol in the club's history, alongside Maradona and Palermo. He was "Mr. Copa Libertadores."

From this stillness, he used his 10/10 vision and 10/10 passing to play teammates in with assists that defied physics and geometry.

He was immune to pressure, as his game was not based on physical reaction but on pure thought. He was an introverted leader who commanded total respect. He famously feuded with coaches (like Van Gaal at Barcelona) who tried to make him run or conform to a system that didn't revolve around him. He played his game, and his game only.</p>
