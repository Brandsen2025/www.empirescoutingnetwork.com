          <p class="lead">"O Divino," Ademir da Guia is the single greatest idol in the history of Palmeiras. He was the "brain" of the legendary "A Academia" teams of the 1960s and 70s. A classic #10, Ademir was famed for his calm, cerebral, and unhurried style. He was a master of the "pause," a visionary passer, and a symbol of an elegant, "old-school" style of play. He holds the all-time appearance record for Palmeiras (902 games).</p>

        <p class="lead">Ademir da Guia, "O Divino," was footballing poetry. The son of the legendary defender Domingos da Guia, Ademir was the opposite: a pure, cerebral attacking midfielder. For 16 years, he was the heart, soul, and brain of Palmeiras, leading their "A Academia" teams that were the only side to truly challenge Pelé's Santos. Ademir played at his own, unhurried pace. He was a master of the "pause," holding the ball to draw in defenders before releasing a perfectly weighted pass. He was not fast, but he was "quicker" than everyone, as his brain was always two steps ahead. He is the all-time appearance leader (902) and a 5-time Brazilian champion, cementing his status as the ultimate "one-club" God.</p>

He was the son of a legend but carved his own, opposite identity. He was so secure in his own genius that he refused to run, refused to hurry. He made the game come to him. His "Divine" nickname was not just for his skill, but for his otherworldly, unbothered, and cerebral approach to the game.</p>
