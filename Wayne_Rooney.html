        <p class="lead">Wayne Rooney was the last of the great "street footballers." He played with a raw, visceral anger that he channeled into breathtaking moments of genius. He was a player of spectacular, "clutch" goals—most famously his 2011 bicycle kick vs. Man City. But his brilliance was in his "total football" DNA. He could play as a #9 (a poacher), a #10 (a creator), or an #8 (a deep-lying passer), and he would do all of them with a ferocious work rate. He sacrificed his own stats to accommodate other superstars (like Ronaldo and Tevez), yet still became the all-time top scorer for both Manchester United (253 goals) and England (53 goals). He was a complete, selfless, and brilliant "warrior."</p>

        <p class="small">Rooney was a psychological "volcano." He was a "warrior" who needed the "fight." His motivation was 100% emotional. When he was "angry," he was one of the best in the world. When he was "calm," he was less effective. He was a "leader by example" who would run through a wall for his team, and his selflessness in allowing other (more "ego-driven") players like Ronaldo to shine is a testament to his core "team-first" mentality.</p>
