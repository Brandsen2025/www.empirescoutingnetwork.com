        <p class="lead">Víctor Ibarbo was a unique and electrifying attacking player. At his peak with Cagliari, he was a tactical nightmare for defenders, possessing the height of a target man (1.88m) with the elite pace and dribbling skills of a top-tier winger. This rare combination made him a legend in the *FIFA* video game series and a valuable asset in real life, allowing him to play as a second striker or on either flank. His Serie A form (130 appearances) led him to Colombia's 2014 World Cup squad and subsequent moves to AS Roma and Watford.</p>

          <li><strong>Confident:</strong> A flair player who always looked to take on his opponent.</li>
          <li><strong>Aggressive:</strong> His style of play was physical and often led to fouls.</li>

        <p class="small">Ibarbo was a raw physical phenomenon. His philosophy was based on athletic dominance. His experience in Serie A, two Champions League clubs, and a World Cup was earned through a set of physical skills (pace, power, height) that few players in the world possess. While his technical finish never caught up to his physical gifts, his peak made him one of the most unique and dangerous players in football.</p>
